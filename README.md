# 🦾 Robot Kit Development
*Educational robotics kit to inspire adults to think about robotics solutions*

---

## 🚀 Overview
- This kit was the medium for Casey Hunt's research on how interacting with a robotics kit helps an individual brainstorm more realistic robotics solutions in a professional environment.
- The main idea was to provide adults with a kit with the least amount of unique parts that could build all common forms of robotics joints and designs. 
- A requirement was that anyone with a 3D printer could print and play with this kit, so I utilized snap-fits and print-in-place assemblies. 
- NOT full kit, just the parts I designed. The full kit will be made free for the public once the research is published, and studies are finished.
- Study was conducted in under ACME Lab, ATLAS @ CU Boulder

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🔹 Gripper Part
  - 🔹Gripper actuated by a string; part is printed in one whole piece with compliant joints
    [![Gripper preview](images/Gripper%20Preview.png)](STL/Gripper.stl)
- 🔹 Hook Parts
  - 🔹Carabiner-lock design; part is also printed in whole piece with compliant joints
    [![Hook preview](images/Hook%20Preview.png)](STL/Hook1.STL)
  - 🔹Optional two-part print for cleaner print job, but requires screw to attach hook
    - 🔹Various configurations are set up in MODCAP+Hooks.SLDASM file as ASSM Configurations
      - 🔹Carabiner Hook on Cap
      - 🔹Carabiner Hook (heat-set)
      - 🔹Cap (heat-set)
  - 🔹Parahook
    - 🔹Concept is the same as the carabiner, but attached to the side of the cap instead of on top.  
- 🔹 Pulley Part
  - 🔹Functional pulley; part is printed in three pieces with snap-in-place assembly
  - 🔹Two configurations in Solidworks ASSM:
    - 🔹Pulley with Crank Handle
    - 🔹Pulley without Handle

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation
- Parts are meant to attach to 1" PVC pipe
- Parts are print and play, with some parts requiring minimal snap-together assembly, and others being print-in-place assemblies.
- Minimal "engineering" was required with only some parts needing heat-set inserts to mount screws
